- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

go to floor in cafes because in campus cafes like compass and the cc you can leave the ground floor. Go to floor in houses that are also dining halls. I figured those kind of counted like cafes but students who live there can go to different floors. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
